## Description

Project Django using Django REST Framework and the database Postgresql.  
The goal is to have a CRM where users could see clients, contracts and Events with different permissions.
***
## Requirements
Python 3 : https://www.python.org/downloads/

Postgresql : https://www.postgresql.org/download/

POSTMAN : https://www.postman.com
***
## Creation of the database Postgresql

In Pgadmin you have to create a new user in Login/Group (can change according to version)   
After that, create a new database with a name, a password and a name of owner (the user you have created before).  
***
## Installation

In the terminal, move to the directory where you want to install the repository with the command line:
`cd <pathdirectory>`

Clone the remote repository: 
`git clone https://github.com/Yonohi/P12_planat_loic.git`

Go into the new folder:
`cd P12_planat_loic`

In the folder settings.py which is in /P12_planat_loic.git/EpicEvents/EpicEvents/  
change the content of DATABASES by :  
```
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql",
        "NAME": "<name_of_your_db>",
        "USER": "<username>",
        "PASSWORD": "<password>",
        "HOST": "localhost",
        "PORT": "5432",
    }
}
```

Create the environment:
`python3 -m venv env`

Activate the environment:

* On Unix and macOS:
`source env/bin/activate`

* On Windows:
`env\Scripts\activate.bat`

Now, install packages from requirements.txt
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Go into the folder named LITReview
`cd EpicEvents`

Now you have to apply migrations with
`python3 manage.py migrate`

Run in local
`python3 manage.py runserver`

Now you can test with POSTMAN the collection P12_EpicEvents
***
## How it works
### POSTMAN:
To signup:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/signup/
```
At this address you can log in :
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/
```
Make a refresh because the time limit for the token has passed:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/token/refresh/
```
If you want to see the different projects go to : 
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/projects/
```
or the issues of the project (if you are contributor of the project) :
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/projects/{id}/issues/
```
or the comments of an issue (if you are contributor of the project) :
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/projects/{id}/issues/{id}/comments/
```
To see contributors of the project :
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/projects/{id}/users/
```
For more information about endpoint, see the documentation on postman:
https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16930251/UVJeGGdh
***
## Need a superuser?
You have to go to the project folder and type
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
Now give your username, mail and password, and it's done. The admin page is reachable.
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
```
